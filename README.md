## Problem Statement
This Android app is used to create a product list and compare prices of the same products among different stores. It also has a barcode scanner which can be used to identify and get the latest price of the product. The application also allows the user to search for a product by its name. All we have to do is to register and create an account. Following that, there are four sections displayed accordingly: Stores (used to find the stores in our area), Products (used to search for a product), Scan Barcode (used to scan the barcode of a particular product) and Compare Products (used to compare the prices of a product among different stores). Our application also features a Price Analyzer that allows you to compare the price of a certain product between two dates.
