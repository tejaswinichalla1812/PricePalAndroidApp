## Problem Statement
People nowadays only spend their money on necessities. As a result, they can only buy anything that is reasonably priced. However, they will need to devote a significant amount of time to visiting all of the stores in order to get product information and conduct a comparison in order to determine which item in which store is more valuable to them. Even if they acquire all of the item details, they will still need to spend a significant amount of time analyzing the items in the stores. Spending their time attempting to figure out all of the product details in multiple stores is a major issue.

## Introduction
The main goal of our application is to build an app for the users which should be very interactive and itâ€™s ease of use, to help a consumer in finding Stores that provide a specific Product in his area.
